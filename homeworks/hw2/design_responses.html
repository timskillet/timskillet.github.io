							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Adding white space to a visual layout can improve the user experience. For example, it helps maintain focus and draw attention to specific parts of a page. It also improves visual organization by separating sections and forming groups.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked their examples of different webpages that highlighted the difference that white space can create. Specifically, Wayfair's homepage was overcrowded with many images and icons. With just a subtle amount of added white space, the improvement made a huge difference.</p>
