            <h2>Part 2: Reading Responses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze product designs while scrolling through them and take note of the intentions of designers for specific features. Focus on things such as hierarchy, content, intent, and audience when studying product designs.</li>
                <li>My favorite part of the article was when the author dissected examples of different product designs. It really demonstrated the kind of attention to detail that designers have and I haven't noticed at all.</li>
                <li>You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product.</li>
